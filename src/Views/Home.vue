    <p>I've spent a good part of my undergraduate studies using R, SQL, ArcGIS, Excel, Tableau and more to analyze and present data.</p>
    <p>Another passion of mine is designing and creating information systems to capture and process data from the real world. Incorporating good design principals to make the most user-friendly applications</p>
    <p>In addition to my study, I have shorn sheep as a job for 3 summers, I am always looking for ways to capture and analyse data related to my work, hence a lot of my projects featured within this portfolio are related to the shearing and agricultural industry.</p>
